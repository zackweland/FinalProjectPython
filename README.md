# Project: Topic Modeling and Character Analysis of Lord of the Rings scripts
# For my project, I plan on doing a text analysis, a sentiment analysis and a topic modeling of the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring movie script. Being that I am currently reading the books again, my goal is to break down the movie script and see how well it matches up with my perception of the characters. First, I will do a text analysis to review the entire script to tokenize words and phrases and examine lexical density, sentence length, and vocabulary richness. Additionally, I will do the same to several characters who speak the most throughout the script. To run these tests, I will use Natural Language Toolkit (nklt). Next, I will run a sentiment analysis, using TextBlob, on the characters to determine who is more positive and negative. Finally, I will do a topic modeling of the script, utilizing genism as my library. Through the topic modeling, I hope to identify the most prevalent themes and their associated words/phrases, along with identifying which character is associated with which theme in the script.
